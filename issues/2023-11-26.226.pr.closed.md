#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69906215?u=46112820add97f16698cb604c938e19092d8c676&v=4" width="50">[Malus-risus](https://github.com/Malus-risus) opened issue at [2023-11-26 05:48](https://github.com/HuanCheng65/TiebaLite/pull/226):

- Used constants for visibility values (`NIGHT_MODE_TIP_VISIBILITY` and `NIGHT_MODE_TIP_GONE`) instead of raw integers to improve code readability.

- Extracted the logic handling the click event on the theme selected icon into a separate method (`handleThemeSelected`) for better code organization and readability.

- Created a method (`showCustomThemeDialog`) to handle the logic for showing the custom theme dialog, improving code readability and maintainability.

- Minor adjustments for consistent indentation and formatting to enhance code readability.
