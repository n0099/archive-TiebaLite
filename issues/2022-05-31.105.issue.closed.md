Hello,

Since the app is open source licensed, would you agree to have it included to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)? It's a strong community (actually almost the unique) focusing on distributing open-source Android apps.

You can find documentation [here](https://f-droid.org/docs/).

If you're interested, feel free to contact @ linsui (who speaks Chinese) or @ Poussinou for further details.

Thanks for your attention and it wouldn't take too much time since their team would help you.

PS: Apps on F-Droid are signed by F-Droid by default, but you can ask for the case of reproducible build, then they just verify if your builds are reproducible and simply distribute the builds signed by you, in that way there would be no problem of distributing packages with different signatures.
