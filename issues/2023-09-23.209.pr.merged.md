1. I think release signingConfig in debug build type is useless, others cannot contribute this project because they did not have correct `keystore.properites` file.
2. Use Default Expressions, see [this](https://github.com/androidx/androidx/blob/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md#default-expressions).

Maybe as #190, fallback to debug signing when `keystore.properites` is not available

Using the same signature on the debug package as the release package is to facilitate coverage and installation during testing (there is a big performance difference between the debug package and the release package of Jetpack Compose, so sometimes it is necessary to test under release)

Alright, I can revert that line of code, but I recommend either switching to a different build variant or creating a new one tailored for this specific case.
